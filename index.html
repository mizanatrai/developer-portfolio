            <p>Being myself – Everyone else is taken.
                Time is precious, waste it wisely.
                I’m a cupcake in search for her stud muffin
                Do you know what I like about people? Their dogs.
                The best things come from living outside of your comfort zone.
                The bad news is time flies. The good news is you’re the pilot.
                No this isn’t a dream, this is my reality
                I already want to take a nap tomorrow.
                If I cannot do great things, I can do small things in a great way.

            <p>So many people have known too well the salt taste of failure, they have plumbed the depth of failure, and
                that has got them wearied, discouraged and ready to give up.

                What they truly need in the actual sense is not a promised trip to Paris, but something as simple as a
                few motivational and inspirational messages, either in written form or spoken words, to constantly
                remind them that they are not suffering but in the process, so as to get going and never back down.

                A friend in need is a friend indeed, be that friend indeed by getting one below and send it to them. I
                know you care!
